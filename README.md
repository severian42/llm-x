[![Deployed to github pages](https://github.com/mrdjohnson/llm-x/actions/workflows/deploy_to_gh_pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mrdjohnson/llm-x/actions/workflows/deploy_to_gh_pages.yml)

# LLM X

![LLM X logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdjohnson/llm-X/main/public/LLMX.png)

# Privacy statement:

LLM X does not make any external api calls. (go ahead, check your network tab and see the Fetch section). Your chats and image generations are 100% private. This site / app works completely offline.

# Issues:

LLM X (web app) will not connect to a server that is not secure. This means that you can use LLM X on localhost (considered a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts)) but if you're trying to use llm-x over a network the server needs to be from https or else it will not work.

# Recent additions:

- Text generation through lm studio is here! 
- Regenerating a bot message adds it to a message variation list
- Message headers and footers are sticky with the message, useful for long messages

# How To Use:

### Prerequisites for application

- Ollama: Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
  - Pull down a model (or a few) from the [library](https://ollama.com/library) Ex: `ollama pull llava` (or use the app)

**_What is this?_**
ChatGPT style UI for the niche group of folks who run [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (think of this like an offline chat gpt server) locally. Supports sending and receiving images and text!
**WORKS OFFLINE** through PWA ([Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps)) standards (its not dead!)

**_Why do this?_**
I have been interested in **LLM UI** for a while now and this seemed like a good intro application.
I've been introduced to a lot of modern technologies thanks to this project as well, its been fun!

**_Why so many buzz words?_**
I couldn't help but bee cool ðŸ˜Ž

## Tech Stack (thank you's):

**_Logic helpers:_**

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

**_Project setup helpers:_**

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vite PWA plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/)

**_Inspiration:_**
[ollama-ui's](https://github.com/ollama-ui/ollama-ui) project. Which allows users to connect to ollama via a [web app](https://ollama-ui.github.io/ollama-ui/)

[Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) Perplexity has some amazing UI advancements in the LLM UI space and I have been very interested in getting to that point. Hopefully this starter project lets me get closer to doing something similar!

## Getting started

(please note the minimum engine requirements in the package json)

Clone the project, and run `yarn` in the root directory

`yarn dev` starts a local instance and opens up a browser tab under https:// (for PWA reasons)

## MISC

- LangChain.js was attempted while spiking on this app but unfortunately it was not set up correctly for stopping incoming streams, I hope this gets fixed later in the future OR if possible a custom LLM Agent can be utilized in order to use LangChain

  - edit: Langchain is working and added to the app now!

- Originally I used create-react-app ðŸ‘´ while making this project without knowing it is no longer maintained, I am now using Vite. ðŸ¤ž This already allows me to use libs like `ollama-js` that I could not use before. Will be testing more with langchain very soon

- This readme was written with [https://stackedit.io/app](https://stackedit.io/app)

- Changes to the main branch trigger an immediate deploy to https://mrdjohnson.github.io/llm-x/
